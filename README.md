# DA-Classification-Text
Using dataset UIT-VSFC (version 1.0) - Vietnamese Students' Feedback Corpus to build classifier using 3 feature extraction techniques: TF-IDF, BoW, Word2Vec

With the TF-IDF feature, BoW uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier algorithm to train the classifier.

With the feature Word2Vec uses artificial neural network CNN + LSTM to perform classification.

The training results of the above solutions are similar.
